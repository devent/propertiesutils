Description

    Loads properties from a properties file. The properties keys are prefixed
with the context, if not already present. The context is an object package
name. For example, if the context object is the class ContextProperties then
the context is "com.anrisoftware.propertiesutils". If then a property with
the name "foo" is requested, then the
property "com.anrisoftware.propertiesutils.foo" is looked up.
Defines additional methods to return different types of properties, like
boolean, number, list.

    The ContextPropertiesFactory class defines various methods to load a
properties resource from the class path. Furthermore, the abstract provider
AbstractContextPropertiesProvider can be used to inject loaded properties
into a class. See the Javadoc of those classes for examples.

* Example Properties File

---
com.anrisoftware.propertiesutils.testString = Foo
com.anrisoftware.propertiesutils.testWithReplacements = Foo ${foo}
com.anrisoftware.propertiesutils.testWithReplacementsSystem = Foo ${os.name}
